Getting Started
---------------

Ensure that you have the very latest code running, with all the tests passing, as described in the [README](../README.md).  Manually test the REST end points. You may need something like the [PostMan Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en).

Please read the high level vision as described in this [blog post](http://nonprofits.agileventures.org/2016/09/28/fallow-day/), and check out some of these resources on participating in an Agile Project

If you haven't already we recommend you run a manual asynchronous vote in the [#async_voter channel](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/async_voter). See the [manual asynchronous vote instructions](https://github.com/AgileVentures/AgileVentures/blob/master/ASYNC_VOTING.md) on how to do do.

See the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/AgileVentures/AsyncVoter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document for information on our project workflow, and getting assigned a story to work on.

If possible please read [RESTful Web APIs](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028468.do) to understand how the core of our system works.
